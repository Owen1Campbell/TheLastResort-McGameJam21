;Jules;Gotcha! I’ve finally caught you now, you—!
;Lady Luck;Hello there, again.
:Jules:You’re the stranger. From before.
:Lady Luck:I most certainly am.

:Lady Luck:I think I recall you said something about punching me in the face. Let’s see if you’re a man of your word.
:Jules:I most certainly am.
:Lady Luck:So bold, to face down Lady Luck and not cower in fear. Let’s see how bold you are once your luck has changed.
