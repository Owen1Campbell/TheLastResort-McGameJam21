:Jules:Hah! Take that! I win!
A sudden chill rushes through the room, and a rumbling voice speaks.
“You’ll regret that. The consequences will find you soon enough.”
Jules scoffs.
:Jules:Yeah, right. I’m sure you’re just bitter about not getting the chance to screw me over again. Well, not this time! Things are finally gonna start looking up for me!
;Casino;The chill returns, this time, accompanied with a dull groan reverberating throughout the Last Resort. 
To Jules’, and every other patrons’ horror, the lights flicker, then go out entirely. 
Missing the power granted by its benefactors, the whole resort shudders, then begins to fall out of the sky.
;End;
